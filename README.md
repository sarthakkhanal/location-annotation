# location-annotation
The tool is developed to annotate location mentions in tweets.

The tool is built over [Laravel V5.2](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2). To run the application, you need to setup laravel authentication to make use of the *login* and *logout* routes and run migration to create database. The annotations are stored separately for each user.

The datafile migration files provide the scehma used to store tweets and annotation by the user.
